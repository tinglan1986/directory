Dataset:
In order to play with the plot in visualization, we have to download a dataset in the csv format. And it is basically a collection of dataset about the sale figure of 16599 video games. 

Docker:
The first step of this project is to create a Linux environment by running with Docker. Initially, we have to find a Docker image, then install it with a new Docker container. Within the Linux environment created by the Docker container, we have to create the directory or folder that matches the name of our Github repository. Meanwhile, we also have to establish a connection to Github by downloading a local copy of the Github repository in the Docker container.

Github:
Basically, we have to register an account name in the Github website, then create a public repository that could be shared by other users.

Gnuplot:
The goal of using the Gunplot is to create a plot based on visualization by using the variables that derived from our dataset. When there are two variables in our plot, we have to use the scatter plot. When there are one single variable, we have to use the histogram. Each variable has to be labelled respectively. The plot also has to be assigned with a proper title. The format of the plot should always be set in the png format.

RStudio:
Similar to the Gnuplot, the plots need to be based upon visualization, except the grammar should be written with the R language. As expected, the title and labels should be included like we did with the Gnuplot. In the beginning, we need to import the raw data of our dataset via the link of the Github.
